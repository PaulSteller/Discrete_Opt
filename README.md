# Discrete_Opt
Assignments and techniques worked on for the Coursera Discrete Optimization course. This is the first time I have implemented many of these algorithms, so they be a bit rough. The problems are designed to be very difficult in that they scale exponentially. I absolutely loved working on these problems, and would highly recommend this free course to anyone wishing to learn about discrete optimization.
